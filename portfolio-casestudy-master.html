                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Storyline:</strong> What started as a few rough sketches quickly became a live prototype powering a major product demo, but getting there meant pivoting fast and designing smarter.
                                        With the clock ticking, I needed to shape a raw UI into a confident, intuitive experience that brought the product vision to life.

                                    <p>
                                        The founder of a promising AI-powered FNOL (First Notice of Loss) application reached out for help refining the product's user experience. While the platform was functional, the interface was minimal and not yet ready for client-facing demos.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        With an important sales presentation approaching in just a few weeks, he needed fast support to transform the experience into something polished, intuitive, and presentation-ready.
                                        This would serve as the MVP for the first iteration, focused on core workflows and key interactions, with future enhancements planned for upcoming phases.

                                                With previous experience in UX from an insurance background, I understood the FNOL workflow and its unique challenges. I started by sketching low-fidelity wireframes in <a href="https://excalidraw.com/" target="_blank" title="Excalidraw is a free, open-source virtual whiteboard tool that allows users to quickly sketch diagrams, wireframes, and other visuals collaboratively, with a hand-drawn aesthetic.">Excalidraw</a> to visualize key tasks and layout options. These early conversations, shared via Zoom, quickly surfaced misalignments, and allowed us to clarify priorities and functionality without getting caught up in visual details too early.

                                        <p><strong>Pivoting to High-Speed Prototyping</strong></p>
                                        <p>
                                            Originally, I planned to move into high-fidelity designs using Figma. But with the presentation looming, I pivoted and went straight to building a live HTML/CSS/JavaScript prototype. I prioritized responsive, mobile-first design from the beginning, even though the immediate focus was desktop, to ensure long-term flexibility and scalability.

                                        <p><strong>Designing with Familiarity and Clarity</strong></p>
                                        <p>
                                            To guide the design, I researched leading AI platforms like ChatGPT and Claude, along with productivity tools such as Slack, Jira, and Monday.com. These tools shaped expectations for visual feedback, clarity, and intuitive interfaces. I applied this insight by incorporating universal iconography, clear progress indicators, and a strong visual hierarchy that kept users oriented and confident throughout the FNOL workflow.

                                        <strong>Storyline:</strong>
                                        A caller waits on the line, but the FNOL system is a maze - slow, repetitive, and disorienting. With every extra step, the pressure builds, and so does the chance of a critical mistake.

                                    <p>
                                        This reflects the real frustrations some claims specialists face, navigating repetitive forms, unclear flows, and high-pressure calls. From a UX perspective, these are not just usability issues. They create stress and can increase the risk of errors during sensitive, time-critical moments.

                                        This project was a focused concept study, an exploration of how the FNOL experience could be reimagined through modern UX principles. It represents a creative, forward-looking approach to guide future improvements, not a finalized solution

                                    <p>
                                        UX research, surveys, and direct user feedback revealed that the FNOL experience was clunky and disorienting. Users faced a complex entry process with little visual feedback or indication of progress, leading to stress, second-guessing, and inefficiency during a critical, high-pressure task.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        They needed a smoother, more supportive interface, one that integrated better with surrounding systems, guided users visually, and adapted to how they actually worked.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The challenge was to reimagine the application as something transparent, intuitive, and reassuringâ€”an experience that reduced friction and supported users through every step of the claims process.

                                        In the realm of insurance, First Notice of Loss (FNOL) is the initial report made by a policyholder to their insurance company, notifying them of an incident or event that may lead to a claim. This notification typically includes essential details about the incident, such as the date, time, location, and nature of the loss or damage, as well as information about any involved parties and witnesses. FNOL is the first step in the claims process, initiating the insurer's response and investigation into the reported event.
                                    </p>

Changes were introduced thoughtfully to align with existing user expectations while ensuring a practical, user-centered solution for the insurance software landscape.

                                        <strong>Storyline:</strong>
                                        You are deep into processing a complex claim when a key detail comes to mind. You go to record it, but the system forces you to leave your workflow, navigate to a separate screen, and juggle multiple tabs just to type a simple note. Focus fades. Details slip. And just like that, something important risks falling through the cracks.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        That was the everyday reality for claims professionals. Through user feedback and collaborative discovery, the team recognized this was more than just a minor inconvenience, it was a persistent friction point that disrupted focus, slowed productivity, and increased the risk of losing critical information

                                        The team was tasked with redesigning one of the most heavily used features in the system, without disrupting the familiar workflows users relied on. While essential to their daily tasks, the existing File Note functionality forced users into inefficient workarounds: switching between screens, juggling multiple windows, or relying on third-party tools.

                                        The experience was slow, fragmented, and often frustrating. Feedback made it clear: users needed a faster, more intuitive, and customizable solution, one that integrated seamlessly into their real-world workflows and reduced unnecessary friction.

                                        In the world of insurance, File Notes are detailed records maintained by claims professionals during the insurance claims process, documenting communications, actions taken, decisions made, and updates about the claim's progress. These notes typically include critical information such as policyholder interactions, conversations with involved parties or witnesses, investigative findings, claim evaluations, and rationale for settlement decisions. File Notes serve as an essential audit trail, ensuring transparency, consistency, and compliance throughout the claims handling process.

                                    <p>
                                        A combination of qualitative interviews and surveys was used to gather valuable insights from key stakeholders and users, ensuring diverse perspectives were captured.

Overall, this hampered the general agility in the product life cycle.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Brand identity and user trust:</strong> the lack of a cohesive look and feel across products contributed to diminishing our brand identity and hurting the connection users had with our product.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> the absence of a structured approach to the UX/UI increased the difficulties in scaling our products and adapting to the future needs of our users.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                    <h4>Approach</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        To address critical user experience challenges, a clear approach was outlined. This started with in-depth research, followed by stages of design, prototyping, and user testing. The goal was to deliver a comprehensive and user-centered solution that improved both internal and external experiences.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Research</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The research phase involved a detailed review of all applications to identify recurring components shared across them. The focus was on standardizing these elements to create a more cohesive user experience. Heuristic evaluations were also conducted to ensure consistency in typography, iconography, and color patterns, establishing a unified visual language.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Design &amp; Prototyping</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Collaborating with designers, an extensive icon library and coding patterns were developed to ensure seamless implementation. Themes based on CSS color patterns were also crafted to enable future updates. Flexible layouts were introduced to accommodate different screen sizes, and reusable coding patterns were implemented to enhance efficiency. A working HTML prototype was developed to test, iterate, and refine designs without affecting the core application.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Usability testing was conducted first internally, then with external users, to validate the design system's consistency and accessibility. These tests focused on ease of implementation and clarity of coding patterns and layouts, ensuring that the system addressed the needs of both developers and end users.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Outcomes</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The new UX design system significantly improved user experience and workflow efficiency. The creation of a layered CSS structure, standard fonts, icons, and behaviors contributed to consistency across products. Written and visual guidelines empowered developers, while a flexible testing environment streamlined the integration of new UI features. The improvements enhanced scalability, user confidence, and brand identity, earning positive feedback from both customers and developers. The prototype remains a valuable tool for training new developers and testing customizations.
