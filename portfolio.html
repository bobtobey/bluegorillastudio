                                <h2>First Notice of Loss (FNOL) Re-Imagined</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Imagine you are on the phone with a policyholder, trying to report a new claim quickly and accurately. But as you move through the FNOL application, you are met with a maze of forms, repetitive fields, and no clear sense of how far you have progressed. You are constantly second-guessing—“Am I almost done? Did I miss a step?”—all while the clock is ticking and the caller grows impatient.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That is exactly what claims intake specialists were facing every day. From a UX perspective, I saw this was not just an inefficient system, it was adding stress to an already sensitive task and increasing the risk of errors at the worst possible time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This project was an exploration into re-imagining an existing application.
                                    It served as an exercise in creative problem-solving and envisioning future possibilities.
                                    The work served as a conceptual approach to guide future improvements, capturing my latest iteration rather than a final solution.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Users of our First Notice of Loss (FNOL) application were frustrated. Reporting a new claim felt clunky, with a complex entry process, and no clear visual sense of progress to reassure users how far they had come or how close they were to completion, adding confusion and stress during an already sensitive task.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They wanted a smoother experience, better system integration, more visual guidance, and interfaces that worked the way they worked.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The challenge was clear. The application needed to be transparent, supportive, and clearly guide users through each step to reduce frustration and provide reassurance when it matters most.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    First Notice of Loss (FNOL) is the initial report made by a policyholder to their insurance company, notifying them of an incident or event that may lead to a claim. This notification typically includes essential details about the incident, such as the date, time, location, and nature of the loss or damage, as well as information about any involved parties and witnesses. FNOL is the first step in the claims process, initiating the insurer's response and investigation into the reported event.
                                </p>

                                </p>
                                <h4>Research</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Through qualitative interviews, quantitative analytics, and surveys the goal was to gain valuable insights from key stakeholders and users, ensuring a wide range of perspectives.
                                </p>

The initial focus is on a primary, aggregated persona for the MVP, with secondary personas planned for future iterations. These personas reflect the core traits and needs of a Claims Intake Specialist, ensuring a user-centered approach to the design.

                                    Usability testing was conducted first internally, then with external users, to validate the design system's consistency and accessibility. These tests focused on ease of implementation and clarity of coding patterns and layouts, ensuring that the system addressed the needs of both developers and end users.

                                    The new UX design system significantly improved user experience and workflow efficiency. The creation of a layered CSS structure, standard fonts, icons, and behaviors contributed to consistency across products. Written and visual guidelines empowered developers, while a flexible testing environment streamlined the integration of new UI features. The improvements enhanced scalability, user confidence, and brand identity, earning positive feedback from both customers and developers. The prototype remains a valuable tool for training new developers and testing customizations.
